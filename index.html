        Hi! I'm Ruohan (Roxanne) Wang, a passionate learner and aspiring researcher in the field of Computational Biology. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an incoming PhD student in CompBio at Brown University. 
        Previously, I received my BS in Computer Science from McGill University with First Class Honours.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm from <strong>Xi'an</strong>, Shaan Xi, China, one of China's historically rich cities known for its 13 dynastic capitals. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        Ruohan, can be pronounced similar to 'Roxanne' with a replacement of the 'X' to 'H'.

    <h2>Research Interest</h2>
    <p>
      I am passionate about harnessing the power of machine learning and deep learning methodologies 
      to tackle significant challenges in the domains of single-cell genetics and 
      electronic healthcare. My overarching goal is to unlock novel biological 
      insights and significantly advance predictive/precise healthcare leveraging 
      these cutting-edge technologies. Additionally, I am keenly interested in 
      utilizing these techniques to expedite drug discovery processes, 
      further contributing to the field of pharmaceuticals.
